"""Reddit — multi-backend: OpenCLI / rdt-cli. Login is mandatory.

Honest tiering (live-verified 2026-06): there is NO zero-config path.
Anonymous .json endpoints are blocked (403 anti-bot, all variants), and
the official API closed self-service registration in 2025-11 (manual
approval, individual scripts rarely granted — PRAW is only an option for
users who already hold credentials). Every working backend rides a
logged-in session: OpenCLI reuses the browser's, rdt-cli imports cookies.
