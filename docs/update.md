## For AI Agents

### ⚠️ Workspace Rules

**Never create files, clone repos, or run commands in the agent workspace.** Use `/tmp/` for temporary work and `~/.agent-reach/` for persistent data.

### Goal

Update Agent Reach to the latest version, refresh upstream tools, migrate from retired backends, and verify everything works. The user should not need to do anything manually (except things only a human can do, like clicking a browser-extension install button).

### Step 1: Check current version

```bash
agent-reach check-update
```

If it says "Already up to date", skip to Step 5 (verify). Otherwise continue.

### Step 2: Update Agent Reach package

```bash
pip install --upgrade https://github.com/lover333101/Agent-Reach/archive/main.zip
```

> If pip complains about `externally-managed-environment` (PEP 668), the user
> originally installed via pipx or a venv — use the matching command:
> `pipx install --force https://github.com/lover333101/Agent-Reach/archive/main.zip`
> or activate `~/.agent-reach-venv` first.

### Step 3: Refresh upstream tools

Run these to keep installed tools current. **Only upgrade what is already
installed — do not install new tools the user never asked for** (the one
exception: OpenCLI on desktop, see below).

```bash
# Python-based CLIs the user already has (upgrade keeps signatures fresh)
which twitter >/dev/null 2>&1 && { pipx upgrade twitter-cli 2>/dev/null || uv tool upgrade twitter-cli 2>/dev/null; }
which yt-dlp  >/dev/null 2>&1 && { pipx install --force 'yt-dlp[default]' 2>/dev/null || uv tool install --force 'yt-dlp[default]' 2>/dev/null || python -m pip install -U 'yt-dlp[default]' 2>/dev/null; }

# rdt-cli is pinned to a git source (PyPI lags upstream) — same pin as the code's _RDT_GIT_SOURCE
which rdt >/dev/null 2>&1 && pipx install --force 'git+https://github.com/public-clis/rdt-cli.git@5e4fb3720d5c174e976cd425ccc3b879d52cac66' 2>/dev/null

# npm-based
which mcporter >/dev/null 2>&1 && npm update -g mcporter 2>/dev/null
which opencli  >/dev/null 2>&1 && npm update -g @jackwener/opencli 2>/dev/null
```

**Desktop users without OpenCLI**: OpenCLI is the preferred backend for
Reddit, Facebook and Instagram, and a fallback for Twitter. Offer it once.
OpenCLI may use only an existing Chrome session explicitly controlled by the
user. The update must never log the user in or read browser cookies:

> "This update can add the OpenCLI backend. Want it? After installing, you
> only need to click 'Add extension' once in the Chrome Web Store. OpenCLI
> only uses the Chrome sessions you already have; if you're not logged in
> somewhere, I won't log in for you."

If yes: `agent-reach install --system --channels opencli` and guide them through the
extension click. If no, everything keeps working on existing backends.

### Step 4: Coexistence (DO NOT uninstall old tools)

**Never uninstall tools the user already has.** Retired backends keep working
as fallbacks where they still function. Agent Reach routes around them
automatically — removal is the user's call, not yours.

### Step 5: Verify

```bash
agent-reach version
agent-reach doctor
```

`agent-reach doctor` is read-only: it never installs or rewrites the skill.
Run `agent-reach skill --install` when you explicitly want to refresh the
bundled skill files.

Check the doctor output:

- Every channel shows ✅ / [!] with a clear message, and multi-backend
  channels (Reddit/Twitter) report `(active backend: …)`
- If a previously-working channel now shows [X]/error, the message contains
  the exact fix (e.g. a venv-reinstall prescription) — run it, then re-check
- `--json` gives the same data machine-readably (`active_backend` per channel)

### Step 6: Report to user

Tell the user:

1. What version they're on now (`agent-reach version`)
2. How many channels are available, and which backend each multi-backend
   platform is using (from doctor)
3. Anything that needs their action (e.g. a Chrome extension click, or a
   manual Cookie-Editor export for Twitter)
4. What changed in this update (release notes shown by `check-update`)

Done.
